# Text-Based-Hangman

This is a simple little program that lets a user play a text-based version of hangman.
Based on the idea of Hangman, the rules for this projects verison are different to the original way to play hangman.

Getting started:
-to get started using this program just download the .java files to your project-source folder and run it.
-in the .wordList file there is an array of words pertaining to a specific topic for use in the game. If you don't want to play with the curent set you can change the words in the array and change the the hint in the intro() method.

Contributing:
-if you would like to download the code for use and make changes, you are more than welcome too as long as it is done under the github code of conduct, which you can find here:
https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426
-update the README under author with your name when you commit!

Known Bugs:
-at the time of commit, there are a couple known bugs in the program:
  -after hint is printed there are two lines that both show the hidden word to be gussed when only the second line for            guessing should be shown.
  -current rule set based on length of word, when right letter is guessed count doesn't move until a wrong guess has been made.
